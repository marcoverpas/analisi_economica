#  Description: A tiny "agent-based" version of the textbook SIM model:
#  several households, each with its own state money (cash) and its own
#  spending choice, added up to get the economy-wide totals
# *************************************************************************
#  Conventions: upper-case = MACRO total; lower-case = MICRO (one household)
# *************************************************************************
#  Story:
#    - each household decides how much it wants to spend (its OWN alpha1);
#    - the economy needs 1/pr workers for each unit people want to buy;
#    - a random job lottery fills those jobs (some stay unfilled = friction);
#    - whoever works makes pr goods and is paid a wage w = pr;
#    - goods are sold first-come-first-served until they run out;
#    - taxes are paid.
#    - TWO independent random orders per period: one decides who gets a job
#      (order_jobs), a separate one decides who reaches the shop first
#      (order_goods). Job rank and consumption rank are therefore decoupled.
# *************************************************************************
#  Note on heterogeneity: each household has its own fixed propensity to
#  consume out of income (alpha1 is a vector, drawn once). Because households
#  differ, aggregate demand depends on which of them earn income, so the random
#  order matters for the macro totals too. The effect is smaller than that of
#  the job-lottery noise.
